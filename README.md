# Base64 Encoding

Just a collection of simple sciripts in different languages that take a string
and encode it into [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).  Mainly used
as a training exercise for me, but some might find it useful.

| Script           | Language |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| encode_base64.js | Node.js  |
| encode_base64.pl | Perl     |
| encode_base64.py | Python   |
| encode_base64.sh | Bash     |
